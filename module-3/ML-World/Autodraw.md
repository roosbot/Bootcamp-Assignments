# Lab | Machine Learning & AI World

Machine Learning now is one of the trending topics if you talk aboyt technology. Everyday a lot of material about this topic arrives to the media, not only news about new discovers but also a lot of tutorials and articles about people working on this.

The objectives of this lab are:
* Get to introduced into this world through the latest most important news we have had in the last years.
* Guide you to do a deeper research to understand them better.

So you will be asked to read a piece of news and then share it with your partners. This way, when we finish sharing, you will have a light idea of the most important events but also you will be able to dig into one specific better.

## How we will do it?

So let's start digging a litle bit. Imagine you open your today's AI&ML journal and you see a very interesting new. You read it but that is not enough. You want to understand:
* If it is so important as the title says (is it really a big step?) or you think it is more important than the title let's suggests.
-- I think the title fairly represents the article. 

* Which part of ML or AI is used and how is it related to ML or AI?
-- Quote: "It uses the underlying technology behind the company’s experimental image recognition software to identify potential objects and pairs that with a database of neat and simplistic hand-drawn images"

* What did they do to take the data? Which data did they use?
-- I Quote: "The actual tech under the hood comes from another Google AI experiment called Quick Draw, which uses machine learning to analyze human drawings and get better over is "a game built with machine learning. You draw, and a neural network tries to guess what you’re drawing. Of course, it doesn’t always work. But the more you play with it, the more it will learn. It’s just one example of how you can use machine learning in fun ways."

* How did they do to build the model. Which type of model is?

* How does it work?

* Why is is useful?
-- It saves time
-- Encourages creativity (or decreases??)

* How could they have improved on it?
* Do you know any other project that applies the same techniques? Could you use something for another use case? Are there other possible uses for this technology?
* Do you find any ethical implications? Collateral effects? How do you feel about this applications? Is it good or a bad? 
* Do you know any news related? What have others said about it?

So you need to look for more information. Maybe the paper the scientists published, other articles, some information about the techniques, ...

Let's start! You will be assigned to an article and a day when you will have 5 minutes to share your research with your colleagues and then 5 minutes to discuss a little bit. Feel free to present your conclusions in the way you prefer.
