Variable naming
Give variables understandable/readable names
 Capitalize all letters of acronyms (HTTPS not Https)
 Never use single character names with l, o, I they look too similar
 Use CapWords/StudlyCaps so CapitalizedWords for class names
 Variable names should be lowercase seperated by underscores
 Only use mixedCase where that is already being used to retain compatibility
 Add suffixes _contra to the variables that declare contravariant behavior
 
 Function names should be lowercase separated by underscores 

Libraries
 Always put imports at the top of the file. Multiple on seperate lines:
	import os
	import sys
 
Community conventions
To quote strings use "double qoutes"


Make use of indents
Use tabs or spaces? 
Spaces are preferred. 1 tab = 4 spaces

Comments:
When writing comments use a space after the hash and one enter (e.g. # Comment)
Comments should be complete sentences (Capitalization)
Inline comments should be separated by at least two spaces and start with # 
Break lines before a binary operator:
correct:
	income = (gross_wages
+ taxable_interest
+ (dividends - qualified_dividends)
- ira_deduction
- student_loan_interest)

incorrect:
	income = (gross_wages +
taxable_interest +
(dividends - qualified_dividends) -
ira_deduction -
student_loan_interest)
