7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.

8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.
Productivity, Music and Photo and Video are the best rated app by users with ratings close or equal to 4

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
The most rated app (games) isn't rated as one of the best. Also the best rated apps are not the most used apps.

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?
By looking at the average rating of the most downloaded apps
 
select prime_genre, sum(rating_count_tot) as TotalRating, avg (user_rating) as AvgRating
from app
group by prime_genre
order by totalrating desc
limit 3

11. Do people care about the price of an app? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
I used the query from question 10 to see if Price has a relationship with Genre, TotalRating and AvgRating. 

The top 4 most downloaded apps have a price ranging from 0.33 to 1.47. However, for Music apps the average price is 4.84. It seems that people do not seem to want to pay a lot for apps like Games, Social Networking, Photo & Video and Entertainment. For Music though, people seem to be willing to pay more. In contrary, people do not seem willing to pay for Shopping apps, as the average price is 0.016
